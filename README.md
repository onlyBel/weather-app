Welcome to the Weather App! This application is designed to provide weather forecasts for a single country. It's simple, easy to use, and gives you a clear picture of what the weather will look like for the upcoming week.

## Key Features
- **Weekly Forecasts**: Get a detailed 7-day weather outlook.
- **Focused on One Country**: Tailored weather updates for a specific region.
- **Clean and Intuitive Design**: No clutter—just the information you need.

## How to Get Started
Setting up the Weather App is straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:
